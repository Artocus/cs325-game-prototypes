The only sound files that come with the game are notes on a guitar, the program reads the sheet music and then plays the notes in time to make the music. This is also what it uses to determine the rhythm.

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
</li>

<li>
I learned how to read sheet music. The hardest part was trying to figure out how to take the sheet music out of the ABC file, and put it in a way that the program can run on the fly. Look at LoadSong.js for how that went.
