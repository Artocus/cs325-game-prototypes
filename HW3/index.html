What is interesting about your game technology?
</li>

<li>
The reconfigure screen is a different scene that freezes the game scene. Also the AI's actions are deterministic, not jsut random.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
</li>

<li>
I learned how to have different scenes interact with eachother and how to make fully working buttons and cutscenes. (Cutscenes were scapped due to time but Cutscene.js shows the framework). The hardest part was trying to get sprite sheets to work, which I just gave up on.
</li>

</li>

<li>
I want them to come up with unique and interesting ways to beat the enemy.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li>
Players click on which move they want to use, and they deal damage to their enemy based off however much health that limb has. However, players also have the option to redistribute their health from one limb to another. They do this by pressing reconfigure, selecting the donor limb, and holding left click to start the transfer.

<li>
I think they will try to power up one of their arms to deal large amounts of damage at once.

A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
