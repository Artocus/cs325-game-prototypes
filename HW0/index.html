<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
</li>

<li>
It's a puzzle game based in math, which I didn't see a lot of when looking at phaser examples.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
</li>

<li>
The mechanics of the game and the buttons avalible took some creativity to get working, also the AI is really good at the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
</li>

<li>
I learned how to place objects and make buttons in Phaser, I also learned how to play this game. The hardest part was making and testing the AI due to the random states of the board.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Chocolate Squares image: <a href="https://www.canstockphoto.com/chocolate-bar-seamless-pattern-36933256.html">Chocolate Bar</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
</li>

<li>
NIM, for no particular reason, shhhhh.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
</li>

<li>
It's a nice little math game about breaking chocolate, and the goal is to take the last be of good chocolate.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li>
I don't really know what this means, but chocolate is pretty cool.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
</li>

<li>
Not relevant apppearently.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
</li>

<li>
We are checking how easy it is to beat the AI.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
</li>

<li>
I want the player to think that the AI as an unfair advantage, when it doesn't.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
</li>

<li>
During the course of the game, the player clicks on one of the C buttons to cut the chocolate bar along the row or column it is next to. Afterwards, the AI will immediately take it's turn and do the same thing. The goal is to take the last piece of good chocolate and leave the AI with the bad piece. As it turns out, this is incredibly hard to do yet entirely possible.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
</li>

<li>
PLAY NIM, I will say nothing more.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li>
In the year 2070, global warming has taken out the natural habitas of all coco trees. This has eliminated the world's ability to produce chocolate. You, a chocolate enthusiast, have just found what could be the last chocolate bar in the world. However, one of the pieces has molded, rendering it inedible and poisonous. As you try to return home with your prize, the robocops capture you and your beloved chocolate bar. The AI overlord offers you a game for the chocolate. Each turn, you can break off a straight line and eat that piece. However, if you cannot break off a piece, you must eat the remaining square. Can you avoid the AI's wraith and the spoiled chocolate?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
</li>

<li>
People that like really weird, obscure math.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
</li>

<li>
Less than a minute.
